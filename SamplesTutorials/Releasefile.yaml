      description: |-
        In order to use Digital.ai Release effectively, a mail server has to be configured.

        This task consists of two steps:

        1. To check if mails are sent correctly, configure the email address of the `admin` user. Go to the [Profile](#/profile) and enter the email address. Then press the **Save** button.
        2. Configure the SMTP server. Go to the [SMTP Server](#/smtp) screen and enter the relevant settings. Press **Save** to confirm.

        Now complete this task by pressing the **Complete** button and confirming. An email will be sent and we will confirm its delivery in the next task.
      owner: admin
      waitForScheduledStartDate: false
    - name: Check email
      type: xlrelease.GateTask
      description: |-
        After correctly configuring the SMTP server and email address for 'admin', the admin user should have received an email that announces the start of this task, 'Check email'.

        If this is the case, check the box below and Complete this task.

        If not, here are some ways to troubleshoot.
        * Check the logs in `[DIGITAL_AI_RELEASE_SERVER]/log/xl-release.log` for errors
        * Reconfigure the SMTP server settings in Digital.ai Release
        * Fail this task and Retry it. Both actions should trigger an email.

      type: xlrelease.Task
      description: |-
        Digital.ai Release is a collaboration tool, so we need to get some users into the system. There are two ways to set up the users. This task explains how to configure users directly in Release.

        It is also possible to integrate with Active Directory or another type of LDAP server. See the [Administration Manual](https://docs.digital.ai/bundle/devops-release-version-v.24.1/page/release/how-to/configure-ldap-security-for-xl-release.html) for more details on this subject.

        ### Creating users

        Go to the [Users](#/users) screen and add a user. You can specify the email address right away.

        After pressing Save, the newly created user can log in.

      type: xlrelease.Task
      description: |-
        ### Roles

        Users can be grouped in **Roles** to assign them fine-grained permissions.

        Go to the [Roles](#/roles) screen to create roles and assign users to them. If you are connected to Active Directory or LDAP, you can also add LDAP groups to roles.

        Define a role **Release Managers**, and add all users that will be using Release as a release manager.

        Please use the name "Release Managers", so the standard templates will be available to them.

        After defining the role, press **Save**

        ### Global permissions

        Go the [Permissions](#/permissions) screen to assign global permissions to the roles.

        To the Release Managers role, assign the permissions **Create Template** and **Create Release** (at least).

        Press Save to apply the changes.

        ### Release permissions

        On the release level, permissions are defined on **teams**. Teams are like roles, but specific to a particular release. Teams and team permissions can be configured on a release or on a release template.

        Teams may contain both users and roles.

        _Skip this task if no Deploy integration is needed_

        To enable Deploy integration, go to the [Digital.ai Deploy Servers](#/configuration) screen and add a new Server.

        Enter the URL of the Deploy server and provide credentials of a Deploy user with at least read permissions (in Deploy).

        When done, press the **Test** button to validate the connection.

        If the connection is valid, press **Save** so this Deploy server can be used in Release.

  description: |-
    This Digital.ai Release template shows the **Blue/Green Deployment Pattern**.

    Blue-green deployment is a pattern in which identical production environments known as Blue and Green are maintained, one of which is live at all times.
    If the Blue is the live environment, applications or features are deployed to and tested on the non-live Green environment before user traffic is diverted to it.

    For more information, please read [Perform Blue/Green deployments](https://docs.digital.ai/bundle/devops-release-version-v.24.1/page/release/how-to/perform-blue-green-deployments.html) on our documentation site.

    This Digital.ai Release template shows the **Canary Deployment Pattern**

    The Canary Release deployment pattern is a pattern where a small subset on your production environment is used to test out new features. The environment is split into a 'canary' part and a 'main' part. The canary part is typically small and allows for fast deployments. A load balancer is used to direct traffic to all parts of the application, deciding which users go to the new version in the canary section and which users remain on the stable main section.

    For more information, please read [Perform canary deployments](https://docs.digital.ai/bundle/devops-release-version-v.24.1/page/release/how-to/perform-canary-deployments.html) on our documentation site.

        The Release Flow editor is where the release procedure is defined. You will see all tasks here, grouped into columns called _phases_. These represent the high-level parts of a release.

        The tasks in a phase are executed from top to bottom. When all tasks in a phase are completed, the phase completes and we advance to the next phase. The phases are executed from left to right.

        You can model your release procedure as a general blueprint for how releases are done from the [Templates](#/templates) screen. You create actual releases from a template. When a release is in progress, you can still edit it, provided you have the right permissions.

        If reality gets in the way of the process, you can still add tasks and phases, and change or remove them. Digital.ai Release keeps track of all changes in the release in the Activity Log. This is an audit trail that serves as a single source of truth for who did what, and when.

        To add a task to a phase in a release, click the **Add Task** link at the bottom of the phase. After you add a task, you can drag-and-drop it into the desired position.

        ### Manual tasks
        Manual tasks must be performed by a person. After you are done with the task, you complete it by clicking **Complete**.
        * **Manual task** - A task with a description of what should be done.
        * **Gate task** - A checkpoint in a release flow. Gate tasks can contain checklists of sub-tasks to be done. Gate tasks are marked by a red border.

        ### Automated tasks
        Automated tasks are executed and completed by Digital.ai Release. No human intervention is required.
        * **Notification** - Send a custom email from Digital.ai Release.
        * **Digital.ai Deploy** - Perform a deployment using Digital.ai Deploy.
        * ** Script** - Run a custom script written in Python.
        * **Jira tasks** - Create and update tickets in Atlassian Jira.
        * **Webhook** - Call a web service using XML or JSON without writing a script.

        ### Execution
        * **Parallel Group** - Execute Digital.ai Release tasks in parallel.

        ### Exercise
        Add a notification task and configure it to send an email to yourself. Use drag-and-drop to place it somewhere in the release.

        Teams are used to group people per release.

        You can use teams to:
        * **Assign tasks to a team**. This is especially useful when designing a template.
        * **Configure permissions**. With Digital.ai Release, you can apply fine-grained security to teams up to the individual release level.

        ### Configuring teams
        Select **Teams** from the **Show** menu at the top of the Release Flow editor to configure teams.

        Here, you can add and remove teams for a certain release. Teams can contain people (identified by their log-in name) or roles (see **Settings > Roles**).

        ### Standard teams

        There are two standard teams:

        * **Template Owner** _(only in templates)_ - Used to configure security on templates.
        * **Release Admin** - Contains the people who are responsible for the running release. They get extra notifications; for example, when a task fails and the release is stalled.

        ### Security

        To configure security on teams, select **Permissions** from the **Show** menu at the top of the Release Flow editor.

        ### Exercise
        Create a team called 'Release managers' and add yourself to it. Assign the next task to this team, and remove the assignment to yourself. Then complete this task.

        **Releases** are at the heart of Digital.ai Release. A release represents a number of tasks with people working on it. Digital.ai Release allows you to plan, track, and execute releases automatically and acts as a single source of truth for everyone involved to make the release a success.

        A **template** is a blueprint for a release. It can be used to start various releases that have the same flow. It is very similar to a release, but some functionality is different because a template will never be executed directly. For example, there are no start or end dates on a template; most tasks will be assigned to teams rather than actual people; and variables will be used as placeholders for information that differs from release to release, like the version number of an application.

        You can see releases that are currently running on the [Release Overview](#/releases) screen.
        You can find the list of available templates on the [Template Overview](#/templates) screen.

        New releases are started from a template. Simply click **New Release** and fill in the name, start and end date, and other relevant properties to create a new release.

        The **Parallel group** allows you to model tasks that have to be executed in parallel.

        The Parallel group is a container for a bunch of tasks that are to be executed simultaneously.

        In the release editor, simply add a Parallel group using the **Add task** link. Then you can either drag existing tasks into the parallel group, or click on the inner Add task link to create a new task in the parallel group.

          The [Calendar](#/calendar) shows an overview of all releases on a month-by-month basis.

          To navigate between months, use the buttons on top or the collapsible navigation panel on the left.

          The filter options give you control over which releases are shown on the calendar.

          * Active releases - Show releases that are currently in progress.
          * Planned releases - Show planned releases that have not started yet.
          * Completed releases -Show releases that have been completed or that were aborted.
          * My releases - Show releases for which you are the owner.
          * Only flagged - Show releases that are flagged with a status message to indicate that they need attention or are at risk.

          The **Planner** shows an interactive Gantt chart that allows you to view and edit the timing of phases and tasks on the level that you desire.

          Access the Planner by selecting **Planner** from the **Show** menu at the top of the Release Flow editor.

          To do detailed time planning, you can move and resize the tasks in the diagram. You can set the due date of a task by dragging its right edge, and set the scheduled start date of a task by dragging its left edge. Note that setting a scheduled start date on a task means that the task will not start before this date is reached, even if the preceding task has finished. You can also move the whole task by dragging it; this will update scheduled start date and due date but keep the task's duration the same.

          You can do more sophisticated in a parallel group. By default, all tasks in a parallel group start when the group is started and are executed in parallel. The planner tool allows you to do express dependencies among these tasks explicitly.

      - name: Using variables (everywhere!)
        type: xlrelease.Task
        description: |-
          When creating release templates, you will add tasks that contain information that can vary based on the release. Also, you may have one generic release template that can be used for the release process of several applications. This reusability is an important feature of of Digital.ai Release because it ensures that you create a template once, and then reuse that template for each application release.

          For example, let's say you've completed your release template, capturing all of the tasks required to release your application. In the template, the application name is the only unique value that needs to be defined for each release. This is where variables come into play. A variable allows you to put a placeholder in tasks and replace it with the actual application name in the release.

          You can use variables in many areas of Digital.ai Release, including titles, descriptions, and fields. You use variables as placeholders when you are creating the template and define their values when the release starts or while the release is running.

          Now that you understand more about variables, you can see that a best practice for creating a template in Digital.ai Release is to look for areas of overlap in your application release processes. If you can consolidate different application release templates into one template using variables, you'll help minimize the overhead your team needs to manage many release templates.

        ## Welcome to Digital.ai Release!

        This introduction will help you to understand the Digital.ai Release product.

        This card is the first task in the **Welcome to Digital.ai Release!** procedure. It has been assigned to '${user}', and that's why you are seeing it now.

        When you have read this, click on **Complete** to advance to the next task.

        Please note - if you would no longer like to have new users receive this welcome release, you can simply delete the **Welcome to Digital.ai Release** template from your **Samples & Tutorials** folder.

      description: |-
        The **Tasks** screen shows a list of all active tasks for the current user -- presenting a list of "to do" items.

        All tasks are steps in a **release**.

        Releases are at the heart of Digital.ai Release. A release represents a number of tasks with people working on it. Release allows you to plan, track and execute releases automatically and acts as a single source of truth for all people involved to make the release a success.

        A **task** can be either some activity done by a person, or an automated task that will integrate with other systems or run a script. Release makes it easy to model your current process and to transition gradually to a more automated procedure.

        There are two types of tasks that are assigned to people: the manual task (such as this one), which indicates that something has to be done by somebody.

        The other one is a **Gate**, which indicates a checkpoint in the release, i.e. a set of conditions that need to be met for the release to continue.

        Click on **Complete** on this task to see an example of a Gate task.

        This task is a 'gate': a set of conditions that need to be completed before we can continue.

        Gates are similar to manual tasks, but have some additional properties
        * You can add conditions
        * You can add dependencies on other releases
        * Gates are colored red to stand out in the Release Flow editor and overviews.

        Tick the boxes below to indicate the progress on this Gate task. When all boxes are ticked, you may complete the task.

        Tasks are assigned to users. If a task is assigned to you and it is active (ie. needs to be done now) it will show up in the Tasks overview screen that is shown when you log in.

        Tasks can also be assigned to **Teams**. The release manager defines the teams in a release. As the name implies, there can be several people in a team. If a task is assigned to a team, it means that it is a joint responsibility to complete the task.

        If a task is assigned to a team you're in, but not to you directly, it will still show up in your task overview.

      type: xlrelease.Task
      description: |-
        There are three ways to finish a task.

        * **Complete**. Marks the task as done and advances to the next task in the release.
        * **Skip**. No work has been done to complete this task, but it can be ignored. The release flow advances to the next task in the release. The user must comment on why this task was skipped.
        * **Fail**. The task can't be completed for some reason. The release is stalled and the task is now assigned to the Release Admin, the person responsible for this release. The Release Admin has to decide what to do next: skip this task or assign it to somebody else and retry it.

        Now press **Skip** to go to the next topic.

        We're now at the end of the general introduction for Digital.ai Release users.

        You're now all set to work on tasks in Release.

        If you're interested in using Digital.ai Release as a release manager, please continue with the guided tour. Like this introduction, the guided tour is an actual release in Release.

        To start the tour, do the following:
        * Go to the [Templates](#/templates) page. (If the Templates page is not accessible, please consult with the administrator of the Digital.ai Release installation.)
        * Locate the template called **Guided tour for release managers**
        * Click on **New release from template**
        * In the **Create new release** page, enter a release name and your login name for the `user` variable at the bottom of the page.
        * Press **Create**

        You will be taken to the Release Flow editor, showing all tasks in the Guided Tour release. The tour is now ready to be started.

        * Click on **Start Release** and the tour will begin.
